Project 2: Library Book Borrowing System
Objective
    Develop a web-based application for managing library operations, including book inventory, member records, and borrowing/return workflows, with role-based access for admins, librarians, and members.
Key Roles

Admin: Manages users, roles, and global system settings.
Librarian: Manages books, members, and borrowing transactions.
Member: Searches for books, requests to borrow, and tracks borrowed items.

Core Features
1. User & Access Management
  Secure login and role-based authorization.
  Permission control for Admin, Librarian, and Member roles.

2. Book Management
  CRUD operations for books: title, author, category, ISBN, publisher, quantity, and description.
  Category management: add, edit, or deactivate categories.
  Search, filter (by category or author), sort, and pagination for book listings.
  Upload and display cover images (store metadata).

3. Member Management
  Add/edit member records with contact details.
  View borrowing history for each member.
  Deactivate members while retaining their transaction history.

4. Borrowing & Returns
  Record book issues with issue date and due date.
  Record returns and auto-calculate overdue days and applicable fines.
  Status transitions: Available → Borrowed → Returned → Overdue.
  Prevent borrowing when copies are unavailable.

5. Search & Lookups
  Typeahead book search (by title or author).
  Dropdowns for category, member, and status selection.
  Date filters for borrow and return records.

6. Dashboards & Reports
  Dashboard tiles: total books, active members, books borrowed today, and overdue books.
  Reports with server-side sort, filter, and pagination for:
  Borrowed books by date range
  Overdue books
  Top borrowed books
  Export reports to CSV.

7. Audit & Notifications
  Maintain activity logs for add/edit/delete/issue/return actions.
  Notify members of due dates or overdue books via in-app notifications.
  UI Requirements
  Data grids for books, members, and transactions with server-driven sorting, filtering, pagination, and total counts.
  Dropdowns (category, status), typeahead for book/member selection, and multi-line text for notes.
  Date pickers for borrow and return transactions.
  Accessible and validated forms on both client and server sides.
  Data & Quality Requirements
  Normalized relational database structure:
  books, categories, members, borrow_records, users, roles, audit_logs.
  Indexed queries for performance (e.g., books by category/author, borrow records by status/date).
  Proper logging, modular architecture, and consistent error handling.
  Expected Outcomes
  Complete borrowing workflow from book search to issue and return.
  Demonstrates secure authentication and authorization.
  Implements reusable UI components and efficient server-driven data handling.
  Optimized database design supporting reliable daily library operations.
  Includes dashboards and reports for effective library management.
